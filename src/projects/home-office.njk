<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white">About the project</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    I worked with Kin+Carta to design the <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">replacement service for the Police National Computer (PNC)</b>, which is used by police forces across the UK to record and share information about crimes and criminals.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The project focused on the design of the <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">LEDS (Law Enforcement Data Service) Property service</b>, which is used by police officers to record information about property that has been stolen or recovered.
</p>
<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white mt-8">What we did</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    We conducted <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">extensive user research</b> with police officers and staff from forces across the UK to understand how they use the PNC and local Record Management Systems (RMS). We also engaged with Home Office staff and other government departments to grasp the wider context of the project.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    One of the biggest challenges was designing a service that would cater for the <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">diverse processes and workflows used by over 50 police forces</b> across the UK. We spent considerable time mapping existing processes to identify opportunities for improvement.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    Using our research findings, we created a <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">representative service blueprint</b> of the as-is user journey. This was instrumental in identifying improvement opportunities and prioritising feature delivery in the new service.
</p>
<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white mt-8">Designing the service</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    I created a prototype of the LEDS Property service using the <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">GOV.UK prototype kit</b>, branded with the Home Office design system. This prototype was tested with users to validate the design and gather feedback for iterations.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    A key challenge was designing a service that would work effectively for <b class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">devolved police forces across the UK</b>. We collaborated closely with the Home Office to ensure the service met the needs of all forces and complied with the different laws and regulations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    We held regular show and tells with stakeholders to share progress and gather feedback. Regular workshops helped keep stakeholders engaged and ensured the project aligned with the wider programme.
