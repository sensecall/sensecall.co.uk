description: Exploring concepts and ideas for a new digital service that could help social workers record notes and assessments more efficiently.

<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    In 2021 I worked with the Department for Education to explore <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">concepts and ideas for a new digital service</span> that could help social workers record notes and assessments more efficiently.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The Alpha phase focused on understanding how social workers currently record information and identifying opportunities to improve their day-to-day workflow. This discovery work was part of a broader initiative to <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">modernise social work practice</span> through digital transformation.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 mt-8 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white">What we did</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    We conducted <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">in-depth research with social workers</span> across different local authorities to understand their current recording practices, pain points, and needs. This included shadowing sessions, interviews, and workshops to gather insights into their daily challenges.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    Using these insights, I designed and tested various concepts through low and high-fidelity prototypes. These explored different approaches to note-taking, assessment recording, and information sharing that could better support social workers in their role.

<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The Alpha phase <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">successfully identified key opportunities</span> for improving social workers' recording processes. Our research and prototypes demonstrated the potential for <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">significant time savings</span> and improved quality of record-keeping, leading to recommendations for future development phases.
