description: Designing a new digital service for HMPPS (His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service) to plan, schedule and manage prisoners' education, training and activities.
---

<h2 class="heading-s mb-3">About the project</h2>
<p class="body-m mb-4">
    In 2022 I worked with <a href="https://www.farsightconsulting.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-primary dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline">Farsight Consulting</a> to design <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">a new digital service</span> for HMPPS (His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service) to <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">plan, schedule and manage prisoners' education, training and activities</span>.
</p>
<p class="body-m mb-4">
    The service was designed to be used by prison staff, including prison officers, education staff and prison managers. The project formed part of a wider <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">digital transformation programme</span> within HMPPS to replace legacy systems with modern, user-centred services.
</p>
<h2 class="heading-s mt-8 mb-3">What we did</h2>
<p class="body-m mb-4">
    We carried out <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">extensive user research</span> in prisons, and remotely, to understand the needs of prison staff and the constraints of the prison environment. These user needs were used to inform the design of the service, which was iterated and tested with users throughout the project.
</p>
<p class="body-m mb-4">
    As part of the user centred design process, I created a prototype of the service using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. This was tested with users to validate the design and to gather feedback for further iterations.
</p>

<p class="body-m mb-4">
    One of the key challenges was designing an efficient way for staff to mark attendance for multiple prisoners at once. I developed and tested a new pattern that allowed for <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">bulk actions whilst maintaining accessibility and accuracy</span>. The pattern was well-received by users and <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">significantly reduced the time needed to complete this frequent task</span>.

<p class="body-m mb-4">
    A critical requirement was the need for <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">clear, printable lists</span> that officers could use on prison wings. Prison officers work in a high-pressure environment where they need to make quick decisions, usually without access to digital devices. The printed lists needed to help them instantly identify key information to <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">reduce risks and maintain security and safety</span>.
</p>

<p class="body-m mb-4">
    We designed the printed outputs to clearly highlight the most important information first, such as security risks and movement restrictions. The lists use a simple layout with <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">clear visual hierarchy</span> to help officers quickly scan and find what they need, even in challenging situations on busy prison wings.

<p class="body-m mb-4">
    Another significant achievement was <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">simplifying a complex scheduling process</span> into a straightforward, step-by-step journey. Despite needing to accommodate various scenarios and requirements, the interface remained intuitive and flexible. User testing showed that <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">staff could quickly understand and use the new process</span>, leading to very positive feedback during the Private Beta phase.
</p>


<h2 class="heading-s mt-8 mb-3">The outcome</h2>
<p class="body-m mb-4">
    The project was <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">delivered on time and within budget</span>, and the service is now being rolled out to prisons across the UK. The service is <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">expected to save prison staff time</span> and improve the relevance and quality of education and training for prisoners.
