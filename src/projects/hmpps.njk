<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white">About the project</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    In 2022 I worked with Farsight to design <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">a new digital service</span> for HMPPS (Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service) to plan, schedule and manage prisoners' education, training and activities.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The service was designed to be used by prison staff, including prison officers, education staff and prison managers. The project formed part of a wider <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">digital transformation programme</span> within HMPPS to replace legacy systems with modern, user-centred services.
</p>
<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white">What we did</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    We carried out <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">extensive user research</span> in prisons, and remotely, to understand the needs of prison staff and the constraints of the prison environment. These user needs were used to inform the design of the service, which was iterated and tested with users throughout the project.
</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    As part of the user centred design process, I created a prototype of the service using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. This was tested with users to validate the design and to gather feedback for further iterations.
</p>
<h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-3 font-semibold text-dark dark:text-white">The outcome</h2>
<p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
    The project was <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">delivered on time and within budget</span>, and the service is now being rolled out to prisons across the UK. The service is <span class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">expected to save prison staff time</span> and improve the relevance and quality of education and training for prisoners.
