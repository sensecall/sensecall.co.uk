# Person Search Pattern

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive pattern for implementing person search functionality across various systems and use cases. It serves as a living document for best practices and expected behaviours.

## Core Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features should be revealed only when needed
- **Accessibility First**: All features must be accessible to all users
- **Privacy by Design**: Data protection and security embedded throughout
- **Cultural Awareness**: Support for diverse naming conventions and formats
- **Flexible Integration**: Adaptable to various systems and standards

## Feature Sets

### 1. Name Handling

#### Core Features
- Multiple first names
- Multiple surnames
- Multiple middle names

- Basic name variations

#### Enhanced Features
- Preferred/known-as names
- Historical name tracking (e.g., maiden names)
- Prefix/suffix handling (Dr., Jr., etc.)
- Phonetic matching (Soundex, metaphone)
- Non-Latin character support
- Transliteration
- Cultural name format awareness
- Name confidence scoring

#### Expected Behaviours
- All name fields should be optional
- Name fields should accept Unicode characters
- Maximum length: 100 characters per field
- Minimum length: 1 character
- Whitespace should be trimmed
- Multiple names should be combinable in search
- Name matching should be case-insensitive

### 2. Date Intelligence
