            I believe that good design can solve almost any problem, and I'm passionate about using my skills to help people and organisations achieve their goals.

            I've been working as a designer for about 15 years. In that time, I've worked with a wide range of clients, from small local businesses to large international companies.
            From 2012 to 2015, I ran a successful mobile app development business, specialising in building iOS apps and web services.
        </p>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            Since 2015 I've been working on a full-time freelance basis, and since 2018 have been working exclusively within the Public Sector.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-m mt-8 mb-4">Away from work</h2>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            Away from work, you can usually find me doing something with my family. With a wife and two young children, there's always something going on.
        </p>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            I recently took up running, and I've enjoyed getting back into shape. When I get chance, I also enjoy pottering about in the garden, walking the dog, or playing guitar. I'm a keen cook and enjoy trying out new recipes.
        </p>

            I don't really spend much time on social media, but I do have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sensecall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-primary dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline">LinkedIn</a>.
