                        The discovery stage is all about getting to know what users need and what the project aims to achieve. We gather valuable insights through thorough research and analysis, which helps us pinpoint key challenges and areas for improvement.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-200 text-lg md:text-xl mb-6">
                        We begin by clearly defining the problem. This means having conversations with both stakeholders and users. We collect data through interviews and surveys to ensure we have a solid understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-200 text-lg md:text-xl mb-6">
                        After collecting data, we analyse it to spot patterns. This analysis helps us grasp user behaviour and needs. We then create user personas to inform our design choices.

                        Finally, we compile our findings into a report. This document includes insights and recommendations, acting as a guide for the next steps in the project.
