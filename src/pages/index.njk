            I've provided design services on a wide range of projects, from small websites to large-scale digital transformation programmes.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Projects have ranged from greenfield projects to others that have involved replacing legacy systems with new services. Ideally, I'm involved from the very start, but I'm used to being parachuted in to help with a specific problem.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Typically, the projects I work on are used by thousands of people every day, from members of the public completing a task online, to civil servants using a system to manage their work.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">

        <p class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I'm willing to work with clients in a number of ways, depending on their needs. This can include working:

        <ul class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 list-disc list-outside pl-5">

        <p class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Although I prefer to work remotely, I can travel to meet clients if needed. I'm conveniently based in the centre of the UK, and can easily travel to London, Birmingham, Manchester, and other major cities.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I'm used to working with clients' existing tools and processes, particularly in the Public Sector where security is a priority.
