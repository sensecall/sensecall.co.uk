            Over the years, I've enjoyed working with a wide range of clients, from small local businesses to large international companies.

        <p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            The most rewarding work I've done has been within the Public Sector, where I've been able to make a measurable difference to people's lives, and the important jobs done by the people who serve them.

        <p class="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            I have also worked in the private sector, where I've helped businesses including Sainsbury's and npower to meet organisational goals by improving customer experience and increasing conversion rates.
