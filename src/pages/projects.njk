            Over the years, I've enjoyed working with a wide range of clients, from small local businesses to large international companies.

                    The most rewarding work I've done has been within the Public Sector, where I've been able to make a measurable difference to people's lives, and the important jobs done by the people who serve them.
                </p>
                <p class="body-m mb-4">
                    I have also worked in the private sector, where I've helped businesses including Sainsbury's and npower to meet organisational goals by improving customer experience and increasing conversion rates.
