            Projects I'm interested in
        </h5>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            I'm particularly interested in working on projects that help people, including those in the Public Sector or charities. I've worked with very large multi-national organisations, but also enjoy working with smaller organisations, either as part of a team or directly with the client.
        </p>

            Projects I'm <span class="underline">not</span> interested in
        </h5>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            I <span class="underline">do not</span> work with organisations in gambling, oil & gas extraction or retail sectors.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-m mt-8 mb-4">Recruiters</h3>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            If you want a copy of my CV, contact me and I'll happily share it with you.
        </p>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            Unfortunately, I'm not currently available for full-time employment as I work on a consultancy basis only. However, I'm happy to discuss short-term contracts and freelance work.
        </p>

        <h3 class="heading-m mt-8 mb-4">
            How much do I charge?
        </h3>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            I charge a fixed day rate (usually between £600 and £1,000 per day) plus expenses and VAT.
        </p>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            When we discuss your project I should be able to provide a more accurate figure based on your needs. I hold professional indemnity insurance and public liability insurance, both up to £5m.
        </p>
        <p class="body-m mb-4">
            Discounts are available for charitable and not-for-profit organisations.
