                            This means looking at users' end-to-end journeys, and thinking about how the

                        <p>
                            This involves designing the things that people interact with, and the way it responds.
                        </p>
                        <p>It's more detailed than service design, and often focuses on the user interface (UI) and the
                            content (words and images).

                            This means talking to people who use the service, and finding out what they need. It also
                            means testing the service with people to see if it works for them.

                            I'm willing to work with clients in a number of ways, depending on their needs. This can
                            include
                            working:
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                        <p>
                            Although I prefer to work remotely, I can to travel to meet clients if needed. I'm
                            conveniently based
                            in the centre of the UK, and can easily travel to London, Birmingham, Manchester, and other
