                    I've been working as a designer for about 15 years. In that time, I've worked with a wide range of clients, from small local businesses to large international companies. From 2012 to 2015, I ran a successful mobile app development business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 2015 I've been working on a full-time freelance basis, and since 2018 have been working exclusively within the Public Sector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working with the <a href="https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Crime Agency</a> as a Service Design consultant.
                </p>
                <h2 class="fs-3 mb-4 lh-1 text-dark mt-5">Away from work</h2>
                <p>
                    Away from work, you can usually find me doing something with my family. With a wife and two young children, there's always something going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I get chance, I enjoy pottering about in the garden, walking the dog, or playing guitar. I'm also a keen cook and enjoy trying out new recipes, though I get less time to enjoy meals out these days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't really have time for social media, but you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sensecall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sensecall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>.
