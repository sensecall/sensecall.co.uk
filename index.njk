                    Hi! I’m Dan Sensecall.
                </p>
                <h1 class="fs-1 mb-4 lh-1 text-dark">I'm a service designer and user experience consultant from the UK.</h1>
                <p>
                    I help organisations solve complex problems by designing services that meet users' needs
                    while also meeting organisational goals.
                </p>
                <p>Typically, I help with things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>service design</li>
                    <li>interaction design</li>
                    <li>user research</li>
                    <li>accessibility</li>
                    <li>content design</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2 class="fs-5 lh-1 text-dark">Service design</h2>
                    <p>
                        This means looking at users' end-to-end journeys, and thinking about how the
                        different services, or parts of a service, work together.

                    <h2 class="fs-5 lh-1 text-dark">Interaction design</h2>
                    <p>This involves designing the things that people interact with, and the way it responds.</p>
                    <p>
                        It's more detailed than service design, and often focuses on the user interface (UI) and the
                        content (words and images).

                    <h2 class="fs-5 lh-1 text-dark">User research</h2>
                    <p>
                        This means talking to people who use the service, and finding out what they need. It also
                        means testing the service with people to see if it works for them.

                    <p>
                        This means making sure that the service works for people with disabilities, and that it
                        meets the requirements of the law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It includes things like making sure that the service works with screen readers, or that it
                        can be used by people with colour blindness.

                        It also means making sure that the structure of the content is logical, and that users can

                        I'm willing to work with clients in a number of ways, depending on their needs. This can
                        include
                        working:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>as part of an existing team</li>
                        <li>with a team of associates</li>
                        <li>with a partner agency</li>
                        <li>directly with the client</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Although I prefer to work remotely, I can to travel to meet clients if needed. I'm
                        conveniently based
                        in the centre of the UK, and can easily travel to London, Birmingham, Manchester, and other
                        major cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm used to working with clients' existing tools and processes, particularly in the Public
                        Sector where security is a priority.
